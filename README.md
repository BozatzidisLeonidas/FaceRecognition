🚀 Exciting news! I've successfully completed Andrei Neagoie's "Zero To Mastery" web development course, delving into a rich curriculum encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, and more! 🌐💻 As the culmination of this incredible journey, I proudly present my final project—an application using the Clarifai API. 🌈✨ Users can input an image, and voilà! The app swiftly detects and outlines the face borders. 😎📸 Featuring React's state management for user login functionality, the app seamlessly connects to a database for secure user data storage. 🛡️🔒 Thrilled to share the skills gained from this course with the world! 🌍👩‍💻
